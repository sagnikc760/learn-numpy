1. Numpy is a library for storing multi dimensional data.
2. 1d array,2d array,3d array etc.
3. Lists are very flow , numpy is very fast.
4. Numpy uses fixed types.
5. Why numpy Faster ? -> Fixed Type
    1. faster to read less bytes of memory.
    2. No type checking when iterating through objects.
    3. uses contiguos memory -> like C like arrays.
6. Benefits:
    1. SIMD Vector processing :- multiple data computation at all the value
    2. Effective Cache utilization

7. Numpy:
    1. insertion,deletion ,appending,concatenation etc. (like lists)
    2. Do lots of more things.
        1. Can do item wise ultiplication.

8. Application of Numpy:
    1. Mathematics (MATLAB replacement)
    2. Plotting (Matplotlib)
    3. backend(pandas,connect 4,digital photography)
    4. Machine Learning -> Tensors
